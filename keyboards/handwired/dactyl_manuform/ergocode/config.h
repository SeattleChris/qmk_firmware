  Handedness Settings - defined in the keymap config.h file.
  One thing to remember, the side that the USB port is plugged into is always the master half. The side not plugged into USB is the slave.
  There are a few different ways to set handedness for split keyboards (listed in order of precedence):
    1) SPLIT_HAND_PIN: Reads a pin to determine handedness. If pin is high, itâ€™s the left side, if low, the half is determined to be the right side
    2) EE_HANDS: Only works if SPLIT_HAND_PIN is not defined. Reads the handedness value stored in the EEPROM after eeprom-lefthand.eep & eeprom-righthand.eep has been flashed to their respective halves.
      For boards with DFU bootloader you can use :dfu-split-left & :dfu-split-right to flash these EEPROM files
      For boards with Caterina bootloader (like stock Pro Micros), use :avrdude-split-left & :avrdude-split-right
      For boards with ARM DFU bootloader (like Proton C), use :dfu-util-split-left & :dfu-util-split-right
    3) MASTER_RIGHT: Half that is plugged into the USB port is determined to be the master and right half (otherwise default assumes left is plugged in and the master).
    4) Default: The side that is plugged into the USB port is the master half and is assumed to be the left half. The slave side is the right half.
